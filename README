This reel was created to address early IMSC decoding issues by providing manufacturers with a reference IMSC 1.0/1.0.1 text implementation. The included tests are all pertinent to subtitles produced for production content.

This test content includes the following assets:

IMSC1-0-1_TEXT_Test-Reel_FMS_v2-1_2018-01-23.xml
IMSC1-0-1_TEXT_Test-Reel_FMS_v2-1_2018-01-23_Backplate.mov
IMSC1-0-1_TEXT_Test-Reel_FMS_v2-1_2018-01-23_CompositedProxy.mov

The IMSC XML file is to be rendered over the Backplate ProRes HQ file. If the IMSC decoding is accurate, it will look approximately the same as the Composited Proxy file. It is acceptable for there to be slight differences in text rendering, since the proportionalSansSerif font chosen by the renderer may be different than what was used for the proxy.

The backplate includes the following:
- Grid with lines every 5%
- Yellow crosses at each corner of the region
- Red arrows which show the X and Y text flow direction
- Sync counter at the beginning and end of each event
