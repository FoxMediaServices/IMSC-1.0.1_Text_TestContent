This is the initial IMSC 1.0.1 Text test content reel.

IMSC1-0-1_TEXT_Test-Reel_FMS_v2-1_2018-01-23_Backplate.mov
IMSC1-0-1_TEXT_Test-Reel_FMS_v2-1_2018-01-23_CompositedProxy.mov

The intention is for the IMSC file to be rendered over the Backplate.
If the IMSC decoding is accurate, it will look the same as the Composited Proxy file.

The backplate includes the following:
- Grid with lines every 5%
- Yellow crosses at each corner of the region
- Red arrows which show the X and Y text flow direction
- Sync counter at the beginning and end of each event
